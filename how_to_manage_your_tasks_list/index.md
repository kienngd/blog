# How to manage your tasks list?


Hello, it is me again. Today I'll tell you how I manage my tasks.

When I take a task, first of all I'll set it one (or more) **tags**. Then I set it a **due date**. And finally put it in to a list. Very simple :).

But remember that **not urgent** task will be **urgent** task very soon. And important, urgent tasks will make you exhausted very soon too. So take care your **not urgent** task carefully before it to be **urgent**.
