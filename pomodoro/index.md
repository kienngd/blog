## History and Development

Francesco Cirillo, a university student at the time, coined the technique based on his observations of using a kitchen timer (shaped like a tomato, or "pomodoro" in Italian) to manage his study sessions. He found that breaking work into intervals and taking regular breaks boosted his concentration and output.

## How It Works

1. **Time Management**: The technique revolves around breaking work into 25-minute intervals (Pomodoros), followed by short breaks of 5 minutes.

2. **Focus Enhancement**: During each Pomodoro, individuals focus intensely on a single task without interruptions or multitasking, promoting deep work.

3. **Rest and Reset**: After four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes allows for mental rest and rejuvenation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Focus**: By setting dedicated time slots, the technique helps individuals concentrate better on tasks, reducing distractions.
